ROG - A simple networked dungeon crawler
========================================

ROG is currently in a pre-alpha stage, and isn't ready for real
players yet, only developers.

Requirements
------------

(ROG may work with different or older versions, but these are what it
is being developed and tested on)

Ruby 1.9.1 (http://ruby-lang.org/ )
Rubygame 2.6.3 (http://rubygame.org/ )
HTTParty 0.5.2 (http://httparty.rubyforge.org/ )
Sinatra 1.0 (http://sinatrarb.com/ )
Thin 1.2.7 (http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/ )

Playing
-------

### Starting the Server ###

    ruby server.rb

### Running the Game ###

    ruby game.rb

The server might not always be running locally, so use the --ip flag
to change the address of the server that's being used:
   
   ruby game.rb --ip 0.0.0.0:1234

Replace "0.0.0.0" with the ip address and "1234" with the port number
the server is listening on.

If you're a developer, and want to skip the player creation screen,
run the game with this command:
    
    ruby game.rb --skip

### Controls ###

Arrow keys - Movement
M - Minimap

### This game sucks! There's nothing to do! ###

Of course it sucks! This game is "pre-alpha", meaning it's nowhere
near complete yet. We're trying hard to get this to a truely playable
state, but it takes time. Impatient? You can jump in and help speed
things along! See the "Contributing" section below.

Developer Documentation
-----------------------

### Files ###

Everything *should* be pretty obviously named, but here's the current
file listing for clarification:

     game.rb - The game client is here
     engine.rb - The game engine, very home made, mostly solid but it
     	       	 still has some rough edges
     server.rb - This is where the server code lives
     dungeon.rb - Contains the dungeon generation code
     FreeSans.ttf - Our font file, this may change later
     scratch - This file is for code that we may want to keep for
     	       later, but it didn't get commited, or was removed at
     	       some point.

### Game Design ###

Keep it simple! We want this to be simple and fun for both players
and developers.

It's designed to be run on a local network, so no dedicated servers,
and no playing with people accross the world.

Some actual design documents *may* be going online soon, but as this
is still pre-alpha, we don't want to get too carried away with design
before we get some more of the base implementation done.
